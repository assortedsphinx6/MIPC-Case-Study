# Biodiversity-Enhanced Portfolio Analysis: Results and Findings

**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Analysis Period:** 2015-2024
**Region:** Europe
**Sample Size:** 1,260 companies with complete data

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis integrates real-world biodiversity data from Finnish ecological observations with corporate financial and ESG metrics to create a comprehensive **Ecological Return Index (ERI)**. The ERI combines four key components:

- **ESG Overall Performance** (30%)
- **Year-Specific Biodiversity Index** (30%)
- **Carbon Emissions Score** (20%)
- **Energy Consumption Score** (20%)

### Key Findings

‚úÖ **Significant positive relationship** between ERI and financial returns (p = 0.021)
üìà **Green premium observed:** Each 1-point increase in ERI associated with 0.055% higher returns
üåç **Biodiversity variation:** BI ranges from 0.83 to 100.0 across 2007-2024
üìä **R¬≤ = 0.42%:** ERI explains 4.2% of return variance (weak but significant)

## 1. Data Overview

### Sample Characteristics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total European companies | 1,540 |
| Companies with complete data | 1,260 |
| Missing data (excluded) | 280 (18.2%) |
| Time period | 2015-2024 |
| Number of industries | 9 |
| Unique companies | 140 |

### Year-Specific Biodiversity Index

The Biodiversity Index (BI) varies significantly over time, reflecting temporal ecosystem changes:

| Year Range | BI Range | Observation |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| 2007-2024 | 0.83 - 100.0 | High temporal variation |
| Mean BI | 27.82 | Average biodiversity level |
| Std Dev | ~35.0 | Substantial year-to-year changes |

**Key Insight:** Biodiversity is not constant - it changes dramatically year to year, capturing ecosystem decline as Finnish forests become net carbon producers.

## 2. Ecological Return Index (ERI) Components

### ERI Formula

```
ERI = 0.3 √ó ESG_Overall + 0.3 √ó BI + 0.2 √ó Carbon_Score + 0.2 √ó Energy_Score
```

### Component Statistics

| Component | Mean | Std Dev | Min | Max |
|-----------|------|---------|-----|-----|
| **ESG Overall** | - | - | 0.0 | 100.0 |
| **Biodiversity Index (BI)** | 27.82 | 35.0 | 0.83 | 100.0 |
| **Carbon Score** | - | - | 0.0 | 100.0 |
| **Energy Score** | - | - | 0.0 | 100.0 |
| **Comprehensive ERI** | **75.82** | **12.13** | **31.93** | **99.44** |

### Interpretation of Scores

- **100 = Best performance:** Highest ESG rating, highest biodiversity, lowest emissions/consumption
- **0 = Worst performance:** Lowest ESG rating, lowest biodiversity, highest emissions/consumption

## 3. Financial Return Statistics

### Return Distribution

| Statistic | Value (%) |
|-----------|-----------|
| Mean Return | 10.95 |
| Median Return | 10.46 |
| Std Deviation | 10.18 |
| Minimum | -23.58 |
| Maximum | 49.05 |
| 25th Percentile | 4.13 |
| 75th Percentile | 16.76 |

### Return Calculation

```
Return = ProfitMargin √ó (1 + GrowthRate/100)
```

## 4. Regression Analysis: ERI vs Returns

### Model Specification

```
Return = Œ≤‚ÇÄ + Œ≤‚ÇÅ √ó ERI + Œµ
```

### Regression Results

| Parameter | Value | Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| **Intercept (Œ≤‚ÇÄ)** | 6.816 | Expected return when ERI = 0 |
| **Slope (Œ≤‚ÇÅ)** | 0.055 | Return increase per 1-point ERI increase |
| **R-squared** | 0.0042 | ERI explains 0.42% of return variance |
| **P-value** | 0.021 | **Statistically significant (p < 0.05)** |
| **Std Error** | 0.024 | Precision of slope estimate |

### Statistical Interpretation

‚úÖ **Significant Green Premium Detected**

- **Positive relationship:** Higher ecological performance (ERI) is associated with higher financial returns
- **Statistical significance:** p = 0.021 < 0.05 (95% confidence level)
- **Effect size:** For every 1-point increase in ERI, returns increase by 0.055 percentage points
- **Example:** A company with ERI of 80 vs. ERI of 60 would have 1.1% higher returns (0.055 √ó 20)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Weak Explanatory Power**

- R¬≤ = 0.42% indicates that ERI alone explains a small portion of return variance
- Other factors (market conditions, industry, company size) likely dominate returns
- However, the relationship is statistically significant, suggesting real economic value

## 5. Component-Level Correlations

### Correlation with Financial Returns

| Component | Correlation | Strength | Interpretation |
|-----------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| **ESG Overall** | 0.245 | Moderate | Strongest predictor of returns |
| **ERI (Comprehensive)** | 0.065 | Weak | Positive but weak relationship |
| **Carbon Score** | 0.031 | Very Weak | Low emissions ‚Üí slightly higher returns |
| **Energy Score** | 0.038 | Very Weak | Low consumption ‚Üí slightly higher returns |
| **Biodiversity Index** | -0.023 | Very Weak (negative) | Surprisingly negative correlation |

### Key Observations

1. **ESG Overall is the strongest predictor** (r = 0.245)
   - Traditional ESG metrics still carry the most weight in returns

2. **Carbon and Energy scores have minimal impact** (r ‚âà 0.03-0.04)
   - Suggests environmental efficiency has small direct financial benefit

3. **Biodiversity Index is slightly negatively correlated** (r = -0.023)
   - Unexpected finding: higher biodiversity weakly associated with lower returns
   - May reflect that high-biodiversity years coincide with economic downturns
   - Or companies in high-biodiversity periods face transition costs

4. **Comprehensive ERI shows weak positive correlation** (r = 0.065)
   - The combined metric performs better than individual environmental components
   - Suggests holistic environmental performance matters, though weakly

## 6. Visualization of Results

### ERI vs Return Relationship

![ERI vs Return Scatter Plot](figures/eri_vs_return_europe.png)

**Figure 1:** Scatter plot showing the relationship between Ecological Return Index (ERI) and Financial Returns for 1,260 European companies (2015-2024). The red dashed line represents the linear regression fit (y = 6.82 + 0.055x, R¬≤ = 0.0042).

**Observations:**
- Wide dispersion of returns at all ERI levels
- Slight positive trend visible in regression line
- Many high-ERI companies achieve strong returns (upper right quadrant)
- Some low-ERI companies also achieve high returns (lower right quadrant)

---

## 7. Discussion

### 7.1 Green Premium Evidence

Our analysis finds **statistically significant evidence** (p = 0.021) of a green premium:
- Companies with higher comprehensive ecological performance achieve higher returns
- The effect size is small but measurable: 0.055% return per ERI point
- Over a 20-point ERI difference, this translates to ~1.1% return difference

### 7.2 Why the Weak R¬≤?

The low R¬≤ (0.42%) indicates that ERI explains very little return variance. Possible reasons:

1. **Other factors dominate:** Industry, market conditions, company size, management quality
2. **Measurement challenges:** BI based on Finnish data may not perfectly reflect European conditions
3. **Time lag effects:** Environmental investments may take years to generate returns
4. **Market inefficiency:** Markets may not yet fully price in biodiversity risk
5. **Data limitations:** Only 10 years of overlapping data (2015-2024)

### 7.3 Biodiversity's Negative Correlation

The surprising negative correlation between BI and returns (r = -0.023) warrants investigation:

**Hypothesis 1:** Economic-Ecological Trade-off
- High-biodiversity years may coincide with economic slowdowns
- Conservation investments may have short-term costs

**Hypothesis 2:** Reverse Causality
- Companies perform well ‚Üí expand operations ‚Üí reduce local biodiversity
- Economic growth in Europe ‚Üí habitat loss ‚Üí lower BI

**Hypothesis 3:** Temporal Confounding
- Earlier years (higher BI) had different economic conditions
- Recent years (lower BI) have better corporate profitability

### 7.4 Practical Implications for Investors

**For Sustainable Investment:**
- ESG Overall remains the strongest environmental predictor of returns
- Comprehensive ERI adds marginal value beyond ESG alone
- Carbon and energy efficiency have minimal direct return impact

**For Portfolio Construction:**
- Use ERI as a secondary screen, not primary driver
- Combine with traditional financial metrics for optimal results
- Focus on ESG Overall for environmental exposure

**For Risk Management:**
- Biodiversity decline may signal long-term systemic risks
- Year-specific BI captures temporal ecosystem degradation
- Consider ERI for long-term sustainability screening

## 8. Limitations

### 8.1 Data Limitations

1. **Geographic scope:** Biodiversity data limited to Finland
   - May not represent broader European ecosystems
   - Other countries may have different biodiversity-return relationships

2. **Sample size:** 1,260 companies with complete data
   - 280 companies (18%) excluded due to missing values
   - Potential selection bias if missing data is non-random

3. **Time period:** Only 10 years of overlapping data (2015-2024)
   - Limited for capturing long-term trends
   - May miss cyclical patterns

### 8.2 Methodological Limitations

1. **BI aggregation:** All Finnish provinces averaged to single European score
   - Loses regional variation within Europe
   - Assumes Finnish biodiversity represents Europe

2. **Carbon/Energy normalization:** Relative to sample min/max
   - Sensitive to outliers
   - Absolute thresholds might be more meaningful

3. **Equal weighting:** 30-30-20-20 formula is somewhat arbitrary
   - Could optimize weights based on return predictive power
   - Different industries may benefit from different weights

### 8.3 Causal Inference Limitations

- **Correlation ‚â† causation:** Cannot prove ERI causes higher returns
- **Omitted variables:** Many confounding factors not controlled for
- **Endogeneity:** High-performing companies may choose higher ESG ratings

## 9. Future Research Directions

### 9.1 Data Enhancements

- **Expand biodiversity coverage:** Include data from other European countries
- **Add temporal lags:** Test if ERI predicts returns in future years
- **Include more years:** Extend time series for stronger statistical power

### 9.2 Methodological Improvements

- **Optimize ERI weights:** Use machine learning to find optimal component weights
- **Industry-specific ERI:** Different formulas for different sectors
- **Control variables:** Add industry, size, market cap to regression
- **Panel regression:** Exploit time-series and cross-sectional variation

### 9.3 Additional Analyses

- **Downside risk:** Does ERI predict lower volatility or tail risk?
- **Long-term performance:** Multi-year returns vs. annual returns
- **Event studies:** How do biodiversity shocks affect returns?
- **Portfolio construction:** Build optimal portfolios using ERI constraints
